# DnD-Bot
## Github
[github.com/jamesw98/dnd-bot](http://github.com/jamesw98/dnd-bot)
## Purpose
I wrote this to learn how to use the Discord API in Python as well as to help players play Dungeons and Dragons more effectively. 
## Description 
This DnD Discord bot lets you do all kinds of cool stuff like creating and editing character sheets, rolling dice, creating and editing spellbooks, tracking initiative, searching for details on monsters, items, spells, and more!   
I wrote this during the Spring/Summer 2020 COVID lockdown, since I needed something to do, and this was a fun little project. I still work on it from time to time, but it is mostly done. It stores character sheets and spellbooks in Google Firebase. Overall, a fun little project. My GitHub repo for this has a pretty extensive readme going over the commands, but here are some screenshots of the commands you can use and what it will give back.
