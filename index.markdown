# About Me
My name is Jimmy Wallace, I'm studying computer science at Virginia Tech, graduating December 2021.  
I have worked as a Software Development Intern at [Digital.ai (formerly CollabNet)](https://www.collab.net/products/versionone) and [SiteZeus](https://sitezeus.com/). I am also a certified fencing coach for Dunwoody Fencing Club and Centenial High School in Georgia.
